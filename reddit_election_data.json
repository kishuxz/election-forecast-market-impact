I\u2019ll offer some refinements and additional ideas to enhance your suggestions, while keeping the core intact.\n\nOn Government-Fixed Market Rates\n\nYou\u2019re right that fixing real estate rates artificially can distort the market. An automated system based on actual transactions, akin to a stock exchange, could work well. To make this practical:\n\nData Integration: Use a centralized digital platform (like a blockchain-based registry) to record all real estate transactions in real time. This would ensure transparency and provide accurate, area-specific data for rate calculation.\n\nDynamic Adjustment: Instead of static rates, the system could update periodically (e.g., quarterly) to reflect market trends without lag, avoiding the current issue of outdated assumptions.\n\nOn Double Taxation and Registration Fees\n\nThe concern about double taxation (registration fees plus income tax) is valid, as it burdens honest buyers and sellers. Your idea of lowering registration fees is a good start. To refine it:\n\nFlat Fee Structure: Replace percentage-based registration fees with a flat, nominal fee per transaction. This reduces the incentive to underreport property values and simplifies the process.\n\nTax Credit: Allow income tax paid on property sales to offset a portion of municipal or registration fees, easing the overall tax burden without losing revenue.\n\nOn Corruption and Black Money\n\nLinking Aadhaar cards to properties is a strong step to curb black money, as it ties ownership to identity. To strengthen this:\n\nOwnership Caps with Verification: Cap the number of properties per individual (e.g., 2 or 3) at low tax rates, as you suggest, but require annual verification via Aadhaar and PAN to prevent proxy ownership (e.g., using relatives as fronts).\n\nWhistleblower Incentives: Offer rewards for reporting benami (proxy) transactions, encouraging public participation in exposing corruption.\n\nYour vacant land tax idea (1% on property price for excess holdings) is excellent for discouraging speculative buying and generating municipal funds. A tweak:\n\nTiered Taxation: Scale the tax progressively\u2014e.g., 1% for the third property, 2% for the fourth, and so on. This would hit hoarders harder while sparing small investors.\n\nOn Rural Development and Uniform Rules\n\nStandardizing setback rules and road widths across India is a smart way to ensure equitable development. To make it more effective:\n\nMinimum Standards: Mandate a minimum road width (e.g., 10 meters for new developments) and enforce setbacks (e.g., 3-5 meters) nationwide, with flexibility for hilly or densely populated areas.\n\nSubsidized Infrastructure: Fund rural road widening through a portion of the vacant land tax revenue, ensuring panchayats aren\u2019t left to fend for themselves financially.\n\nCar-Friendly Planning: Require new developments to include parking provisions (e.g., one spot per household) to match rising car ownership.\n\nAdditional Suggestions\n\nRental Market Boost: High property prices often stem from a lack of affordable rental options. Offer tax breaks to developers who build and maintain rental housing, reducing pressure on ownership demand.\n\nDigitized Land Records: Accelerate the digitization of land titles (like the Digital India Land Records Modernization Programme) to prevent disputes and fraud, which inflate prices.\n\nZoning Reforms: Enforce clear zoning laws to prevent commercial misuse of residential land, which often drives up costs in urban areas.\n\nYour ideas tackle affordability, corruption, and infrastructure head-on. With some of these tweaks\u2014dynamic pricing, progressive taxes, and standardized planning\u2014they could be even more robust and practical for implementation. What do you think about these additions? Anything else you\u2019d prioritize?",

The Central Government needs to find a way to distinguish record keeping of lands/real estate while ensuring that states don\u2019t lose land revenue. This will pave the way forward for combatting a certain level of corruption in real estate. \n\n2. Land use regulations are largely controlled by state governments today. The Constitution provides for the delegation of powers in this area from State Governments to municipal and local bodies but this isn\u2019t being done. We need to get our MLAs to relinquish this power, failing which the Center needs to step in with strong legislation and enforcement.",

To a certain extent, the central government has done coastal zoning reform (CRZ) but other than that urban zoning must be local with a certain guideline set by the Center. The emphasis on local is because cities should have control over how they\u2019re built rather than having that power vested in the state or central government.

One guy buys 100 properties and inflates the prices.  He will put them vacant.  What is the use?  If the government taxes less for 2 properties he can use them for home and business.  Anything above that should have a higher vacant land tax.  My suggestion would make people buy only if it is necessary.  Land is a resource of the country and we cannot create virtual land.

Giving them land alone won't help. They will simply siphon the land and start building apartments on it if they can.

In the beginning if the business is low they can't spend such expenses from their pockets.  During COVID times the government might have given the officers discretion to waive off such bills.  But practically they were not cooperative.  They were only in a harassing mood.  If the power sector is privatised it will be helpful.  \nThe power bill should be simple and straightforward.

Within this pack, India and Brazil are better off due to their deep domestic capital markets and low external vulnerabilities, say Moody\u2019s analysts.\n\nIndia\u2019s economic challenges may have bottomed out, say JM Financial analysts, citing easing inflation, crude prices, and interest rates. The Reserve Bank of India and the government have wiped out a severe cash crunch, with banks parking surplus funds with the central bank for the first time since mid-December. \n\nBefore the trading day starts we bring you a digest of the key news and events that are likely to move markets.

So, not sure you'd be interested in my views.\n\nYour points are valid. However, I believe the issue is neither of religion, nor ideology. These are masks used by politicians and people who lack critique of their own views and thoughts. At the core, I see majority of both - hindus and muslims of this nation to be more similar than different. They are equally petty minded, equally aroused on meaningless things, equally indulging in one-upmanship and so on. The fact that muslims are in minority make them more vulnerable to sufferings when hindus adopt majoritarian posture. We don't know our history. Even when we know some bit, it is not a shared history among people. People of different religions, different castes and geographical regions have their own version of history. When you do not have a shared sense of past, how can you create a shared sense of future. We are too easy to get corrupted morally to meet some immediate goals. So, the bottomline is, we are a petty, cheap, apathetic and hopeless people who are mostly preoccupied with survival to bother about society or any ideology or principles. It doesn't matter what we preach. \n\nI know my views will not help you. There isn't much that one can say to help you. These are testing times at many levels. The best that one can do is to develop a fictitious or mental shield around oneself to stay sane and grow as a human being. Try doing that. While doing so, if you can influence few people (irrespective of their religion), please do. That's what i try to do and therefore my suggestion.",
