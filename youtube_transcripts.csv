1Iy0nNsuM9w,https://youtu.be/1Iy0nNsuM9w?si=LSS-iCirGKtdOpXu,all India numbers let's put out the all India numbers like we said the projection is for 543 seats we have pulled 518 Loa seats and the remaining seats are projections we' got the all- India numbers NDA can get to not the BJP the NDA can get to these are the final projections the BJP anywhere between 305 to 315 that means they will do better than 2019 but is it by a huge margin will they cross 330 with the Target that the projections don't show that they show it's a fantastic phenomenal majority Modi ke guarantee is working on ground it is delivering for the BJP and the NDA partners are also delivering to take it close to the 370 number that the Prime Minister set for the party but the NDA will get that Char par is not happening but is happening so nearly about the NDA will be clearly nearly 98 seats more than the majority number of 272 the IND gandan can Max get up to 140 seats the Congress can do 10 better at the worst 10 better than last time at its best about 28 better than last time so that's the big story ladies and gentlemen that about uh sorry 18 better than last time so this is this is the story of uh the congress party 62 to 72 seats so 20 seats better than last time 52 the Congress won the last time around it can get at best 20 seats more so it's not going to be reduced to less than 40 seats seats as the BJP claimed but the majority the number here at the news 18 Mega exit pole number number the 305 to 350 in the median is for the BJP 355 to 370 so you will have about 362 seats for the for the NDA that's the number Harish ra is joining us at this to get this number after 10 years in power is a phenomenal phenomenal achievement Harish raat G mukyamantri here we'll go to him in just one second but we have our guests here your first reaction SM prakash opas Gupta V sang is also joining us this is a huge thing after 10 years in power if they're coming back if Mr Modi is coming back with a bigger mandate than 2019 that is phenomenal yes I uh completely agree with you that uh these numbers are very flattering for anybody who has planned a campaign planned an election because uh even if you say that there was no anti-incumbency to come up with an ideation to fight a United opposition because they didn't do that earlier to fight a United opposition I think this is very creditable if these numbers are there as far as uh the Congress is concerned they have not been able to capitalize on even an alliance coming together so 18 better than last time is really not creditable and to lose election after election and not have heads role in your party is something which I can't figure out why any political party would continue I mean imagine a scenario now if Modi was to two was to lose two elections do you think that the party will continue with the Modi adani lost two elections and he was told to sit at home it's not going to happen in any political part this two decades 2004 to 2024 two decades is the story shant the all India number on the on the side all India number is right above us on the and we put it on the screen also there
